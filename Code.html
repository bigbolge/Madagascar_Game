/*This is a problem i am having it sorts itself out once lisa is fired 
The timer on the instance of lisa is starting straight away
but lisa is not added to the container until the space bar is pushed.
lisa can not be added to a timer like "fallingCats" as she will be added 
continiousely without pressing the space bar i cannot create a link to hold/not start
the lisaTimer on the instance within the frame code.
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
at Lisa/timerEvent()
at flash.utils::Timer/_timerDispatch()
at flash.utils::Timer/tick()

also i had trouble with variables once they are in a function i cant use them again such as myTimer.stop():
